Installation
=============

We use Apache Maven build automation tool.

Using command line
------------------

Install Maven on the computer.
``sudo apt install maven``

*Make sure that you are using Java 1.8 both for* ``java`` *and* ``javac`` *! You can check this by running* code-block::

   > javac -version
   > java -version

Clone the Dialog Manager repository.

``git clone --recursive https://github.com/Roboy/roboy_dialog``

Navigate to the root module.

``cd roboy_dialog``

Download roboy parser.

``git submodule update --init ./roboy_parser``

Install roboy parser as described in the roboy_parser docs or the 'semantic parser' page in 'INTERFACES AND SCOPE'.

Compile the project - Maven will take care of the rest.

``mvn clean install``

Execute the project.

``./start.sh``


Using IDE (Eclipse, Intellij IDEA)
----------------------------------

Clone the Dialog Manager repository.
``git clone https://github.com/Roboy/roboy_dialog``

Now, import Dialog System as a Maven project into the IDE of your choice. Build and execute using ``roboy.dialog.ConversationManager`` as the main class.
