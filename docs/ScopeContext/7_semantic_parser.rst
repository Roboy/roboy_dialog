Semantic Parser
===============

Semantic parser is used to translate text representation into formal language representation. The aim is to be able to process user utterances and react upon them.

roboy_parser is based on `SEMPRE <http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/sempre/>`_ . It is currently being modified to fulfill Roboy Dialog system needs.


Installation
------------

By installing dialog via the main POM file, it will automatically install the parser complete, with all dependencies. For information, see `here <http://roboydialog.readthedocs.io/en/master/Usage/0_installation.html>`_.

Architecture
------------

Semantic parser is based on the language model and NLP algorithms that then apply rules to the utterance to translate it. Language model consists of:
- set of grammar rules,
- lexicon,
- training dataset.

General architecture can be seen on the diagram below.

Implementation
--------------

roboy_parser is a separate Java project and is communicating using ``WebSocket``. Dialog system has a client implemented in ``SemanticParserAnalyzer.java`` class. It is therefore part of Natural Language Understanding unit.

Current parser was modified from SEMPRE and currently has following components

  "Follow-up", "Parser", "Follow-up questions for underspecified term"

Usage
-----

The parser has been configured, so that it is automatically started when dialog is started. Dependencies and resources shall be automatically downloaded for you.

If you wish to start parser individually, there are basic instructions on that in the README.md file of Dialog or more advanced to be found in the parser documentation.

Configurations
""""""""""""""

To test parser, you can run following execution configurations using ``maven``. For more information refer to `project documentation <http://github.com/Roboy/roboy_parser>`_
