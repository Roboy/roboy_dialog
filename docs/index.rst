Roboy Dialog System
===========================================================

The Roboy Dialog System (RDS) is a sophisticated software module representing the cognitive capabilities
of the humanoid anthropomimetic robot Roboy.
The goal of the project is to implement dialog routines and knowledge extraction for a realistic human-like
conversation flow which is achieved by utilizing various behaviour models represented by the State Machine (RDSM) finite automaton
defined via a certain Roboy Personality description (file).
Within the particular conversation flow stages, the behavioural variability is obtained by extending and redefining
the common RDSM State to produce a certain social interaction.
The RDMS State both as actor and as reactor regarding the internally formulated output and externally acquired input.
For example, the voice input is processed via the Listening Device -> Speech-to-Text -> Analyzers & Semantic Parser -> Linguistics package
-> (InferenceEngine) -> State sequence.
The RDS in- and output is not limited to speech. It also supports functionalities like emotional in/output, acting on the actual roboy and being deployed on a multitude of communication channels for a broader interaction audience.

The overview diagram shows the external systems which Dialog System interacts with, and the tasks for which the system is responsible.

Status
------

Stable functionality:

- Roboy introduces himself
- Roboy answers questions about himself
- Roboy answers questions about facts
- Roboy recognizes once someone saying one's name
- Roboy asks questions about people he meets
- Roboy stores and retrieves the information about people he meets
- Roboy stores and retrieves the information about himself
- Roboy Dialog is deployable on multi-user communication channels

In development:

- Roboy updates the information (name, occupation, ect.) about people he meets
- Roboy updates the information about himself
- Roboy recognizes the intent behind an asked questions (age, creator, capabilities etc.)
