/**
 * Currently Roboys main personality. It tries to engage with people in a general
 * small talk, remember what was said and answer questions. The small talk personality
 * is based on a state machine, where each input is interpreted in the context of the
 * state Roboy is currently in to determine respective answers.
 * 
 * Since this was used for the last demo, quite some refaktoring is needed here to 
 * tidy up the code again.
